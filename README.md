## License

[License your repository](ï»¿https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repositoryï»¿) with some license that says future students and faculty could build on your work (e.g. the MIT license or a "Copyleft" license if you prefer)

## The Team

Mostly just to make sure you each have access and can pull and push to the repo, add your name here:
1. Cameron Harmon
1. Arthur Schevey
1. Joshua Nunez

## Scaffolding

In the Wedge of Django, they show you how to work with the [django-crash-starter](https://github.com/feldroy/django-crash-starter) cookiecutter template. That template is likely sufficient for your final project. For your reference, there's also a more "production-ready" (i.e. complicated) cookiecutter template for django projects built and maintained by some of the same cast of characters. The latter is called simply (if not so humbly ðŸ˜³) [Cookiecutter Django](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django/) and its documentation especially about [the project generation options is here](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project-generation-options.html).

Talk with your team and choose one of these cookiecutter templates and run it to get things rolling.

## Task Board

It's not exactly time yet, but if you're excited I don't want to stand in the way. For (at least) the last 6 weeks of the semester, we'll organize your work into 2-week "Sprints" using a "task board". GitHub has a feature that the unfortunately call "projects" that we can use to plan and coordinate. There are many templates available, perhaps the "Featued" template titled "Iterative Developement" would be a good choice.

1. Find the "Projects" tab at the top of your repo in github
2. Click the arrow beside the green "Link Project" button and choose "New Project"
3. I guess now you also have to click "New Project" ðŸ™„
4. find the "iterative development" template and choose it.
